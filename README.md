##  Key Features

###  Secure Auto-Login with Focus Protection
Stop worrying about typing your password into Discord or Google Chrome by mistake!
- **Smart Detection:** LoLHub checks if the "Riot Client" window is in focus before typing.
- **Auto-Abort:** If you alt-tab during the login process, it immediately stops typing to prevent credential leakage.
- **Safety First:** Your passwords are encrypted locally and never leave your computer.

###  Multi-Server & "Other" Category Support
- **Global Support:** Manage accounts across all Riot regions (EUW, TR, NA, KR, etc.).
- **New "Other" Category:** Store accounts for friends or other purposes without polluting your main list or triggering rank update errors.

###  Ranked Stats & Decay Tracking
- **Real-time Updates:** Automatically syncs Rank, LP, and Winrate directly from the LCU.
- **Decay Warnings:** For Diamond+ players, see exactly how many days until decay directly on the card.
- **Visual Inventory:** View your owned Champions and Skins with beautiful artwork.

###  Modern & Fast
- **Electron-based:** Built on modern web technologies for a smooth, responsive UI.
- **Local Storage:** All data is stored locally on your machine.
